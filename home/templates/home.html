                    </em>
                    Pursuing in the field of  software development, and working on projects that are useful to the community has been
                    my ambition since I was in high school. Unfortunately after graduating from high school, I was enrolled in the school of education.
                    That didn't stop me from pursuing my dream of becoming a software developer. I went down the rabbit hole and started learning HTML & CSS3.
                    I used the free online tutorial site <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> to learn the basics of HTML & CSS3. I then moved onto learning Python
                    and later on Django.
                    <br><br>
                    Doing this, I have developed a strong foundation in programming and have gained a good understanding of the fundamentals of programming.
                    And it has helped me to develop a strong passion for programming. So, to break from the bulk of the tutorials, I decided to apply for a bachelor's degree in software Engineering.

                            On <date>July 2022</date> I applied to African Leadership University (ALU) and I got accepted. I also applied for a scholarship and luckily
                            I manged to get a <currency>$2ooo</currency> worth schorlaship waived against <currency>$3000</currency> which

                    soon for me considering my financial preperation and so I had to make a defferal until <date>January 2023</date> believing
                    that by then I would have enlighted some weigh down.
